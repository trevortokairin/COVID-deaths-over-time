# COVID-19 deaths over time function and graph
Overview:

The graph_deaths_over_time function generates a time series visualization of COVID-19 deaths. It plots the daily death counts over time, along with moving averages to show longer-term trends.

The function accepts a Pandas DataFrame containing state-level COVID case data as input. It processes this to calculate total deaths by date and generate the time series chart using Matplotlib.

Business Implications:

Visualizing COVID deaths over time provides important insights for policymakers, public health officials, and healthcare providers including:

Identifying periods of higher vs lower deaths to guide resource allocation to hospitals
Pinpointing impact of policy interventions by analyzing changes in trends
Forecasting future trajectories based on smoothing curves
Communicating trends and statistics visually to the public
More broadly, the function provides an example of how Python data visualization libraries can be leveraged to generate business charts. The output helps decision makers identify patterns, understand relationships, and spot outliers in time series data.

Flexible data visualization is crucial for monitoring KPIs, communicating insights, and making data-driven strategic decisions across industries. This function demonstrates core capabilities using common Python data science libraries.
